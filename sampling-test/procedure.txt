Part 1
------

- Wildcat Sandbagger
- Grind 1.50, 6.5 bar
- Whatman 5 filter
- 20 g out in 50 seconds
- Filter twice with Chemex
    - Second filter much faster than first
    - Indicates the first filter did most of the work
- Cool in water bath

- Dry sample boats at 350 F for 30 minutes
- Cool sample boats for 10 minutes
- Weigh empty boats

- Initially flush pipette with sample solution
- Stir throughly
- Draw samples at intervals
    - Samples drawn from just below surface
    - No flushing pipette--use a single draw
- Weigh filled sample boats
- Dry in oven at 212 F

- In oven at 1120
- Oven off at 1900
- Oven on at 1015
- Oven off at 1400
- Oven on at 0530

Part 2
------

- Clean demitasse with distilled water
- Dry with microfibre cloth
- Add 49.63 g distilled water
- Add 10.045 g sugar
- Total weight 59.69 g
- Stir with glass rod

- Flush pipette with sugar solution
- Weigh empty boats
- Transfer 4 g solution to each boat
- Weight of each boat kept creeping downward
    - Not a scale issue, I think, as the 5 g calibration weight never changed
    - Also, 0.01 g scale measured the same changes
    - Could be evaporation
    - 26 C room temperature; 40% relative humidity (according to Nest thermostat)

Part 3
------

- Evaporation rate measurement
- Empty weighing boat = 0.741 g; empty DiFluid = 23.33 g
- Weighing boat diameter = 47.5 mm; DiFluid sample diameter = 8.85 mm at fluid level
- 26 C room temperature; 40% relative humidity (according to Nest thermostat)
- Add 3 drops of distilled water to DiFluid and about 6 g of distilled water to weighing boat
- At 14:45, room temperature is still 26 C
- DiFluid diameter 6 mm below chamfer
